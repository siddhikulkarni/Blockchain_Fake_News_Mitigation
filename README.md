# Blockchain_Fake_News_Mitigation
With the increasing popularity of the various social media platforms, detecting and
dealing with misinformation and their creators becomes a critical problem. Current
approaches entrust content verification to a single centralised authority which lack
verification checks and make content verification difficult to access and use. In
response, our ambition is to create an open, democratic and distributed ecosystem
that allows easy access to verified content ensuring scalability and establishing
trust in a completely decentralized environment.
